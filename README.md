python-solvespace
=================

Python library from solver of Solve Space. 

Use for academic research and learning.

Project-files
=================

Put these files into a same folder (Or you can just use them):

````
solvespace/exposed/_slvs.pyd
solvespace/exposed/libslvs.so
solvespace/exposed/slvs.py
solvespace/exposed/Usage.py
````

Edit `Usage.py` to design a subject.

(You can reference `DOC.txt`!)

And then execute `python Usage.py` in Command Prompt of Windows.

So `slvs.py` will ask `_slvs.pyd` and `libslvs.so` to solve subject.

In Ubuntu, you need to rebuild `_slvs.pyd` to `_slvs.so`.

Original `_slvs.so` is not compatible with Linux OS.

ï¼ŠOf crouse you need to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) within Python 3.
